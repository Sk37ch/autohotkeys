#Autohotkeys

This repo contains my autohotkeys file. As far as I know, autohotkeys works only
on Windows, but I would also like to get a linux version, and transfer the
script to that as well. If and when that happens, it will be here.

Some features of this script include:
* Automated mouse click when you stop moving the mouse.
* Remapping of the numpad with numlocks off:
    * 4 is double click
    * 5 is single left click
    * 6 is right click
* alt+F1 is a shortcut to toggle this script on and off.
* Caps lock is remapped to ESC (for use with vim. Caps lock keyboard light is
  disabled).
* winkey+g opens a new tab that goes to google.ca
